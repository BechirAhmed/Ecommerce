For the requirements of the course of E-Commerce Technologies, an Android Application for booking rooms/residences, similar to Airbnb Application, was implemented. This report includes a short definition and description of E-commerce characteristics, the purpose of implementing this application and also fully analyzes the design decisions, the assumptions and all necessary details related to the project. 

Electronic commerce (e-commerce) is a type of business model, or segment of a larger business model, that enables a firm or individual to conduct business over an electronic network, typically the Internet. Electronic commerce operates in all four of the major market segments: business to business, business to consumer, consumer to consumer and consumer to business. Almost any product or service can be offered via e-commerce, from books and music to financial services and plane tickets. E-commerce has allowed firms to establish a market presence, or to enhance an existing market position, by providing a cheaper and more efficient distribution chain for their products or services. 

There are several types of electronic commerce. The most common is business to consumer, in which a business sells products or services directly to consumers over the Internet. An example of a business to consumer e-commerce transaction would be an individual purchasing a pair of sneakers through Nike's website. Another type of electronic commerce is business to business, where companies sell products or services to other companies over the Internet. An example would be the company GoDaddy, which sells domain names, websites, and hosting services to other businesses. Consumer to business electronic commerce involves consumers selling products or services to businesses. You've taken part in this form of e-commerce if you've ever completed a paid online survey where you've given your opinion about a product. Finally, there is consumer to consumer e-commerce, which is where consumers sell products to other consumers via a site such as Amazon or eBay.

The rise of e-commerce forces IT personnel to move beyond infrastructure design and maintenance and consider numerous customer-facing aspects such as consumer data privacy and security. When developing IT systems and applications to accommodate e-commerce activities, data governance related regulatory compliance mandates, personally identifiable information privacy rules and information protection protocols must be considered.

Some benefits of e-commerce include its around-the-clock availability, the speed of access, the wide availability of goods and services for the consumer, easy accessibility, and international reach. Its perceived downsides include sometimes-limited customer service, consumers not being able to see or touch a product prior to purchase, and the necessitated wait time for product shipping.

The purpose of this project is the implementation of an Android Application for booking rooms/residences, enabling users to lease or rent short-term lodging including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms. Therefore, in this application each user can have two roles. Once someone is registered, by default has the tenant (user) role. This means that he can search a residence, make a reservation, review/comment etc. However, there is also the ability to take over the role of host and upload residences for booking followed by specific characteristics and availability periods. Below, the design of the database, the RESTful services and all the screens of the application are described further.
